After 3 years of college studying applied informatics and 1,5 year of professional software development, few articles on dev.to (really cool site, go check it out) I finally decided to start my own blog.<br>
<br>

## WHY?

_"An alleged scientific discovery has no merit unless it can be explained to a barmaid."_ [[1]](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en)
<br>

As a junior developer I naturally want to be better in every way possible. So that’s that. Also, I want to give back to community that taught me so much. I often find myself helping my peers with assignments to school and I really like it, so this is kinda something similar. Sometimes I like to talk about basics to some beginners and sometimes about advanced technical stuff with senior developers or just some more skilled friends or classmates.<br>
<br>

## WHAT?

That it’s basically my vision for this blog. I want to write about variety of technical stuff. Sometimes programming languages/technologies that I already know (maybe some tutorials for beginners) and also languages/technologies that I’m learning (to maybe get some feedback or some interesting insights).<br>

The first thing I want to write about is building this site. What tools and technologies I’ve used and the whole process. I don't want to share my current plans for this blogs because they can (and will) change.<br>
<br>

As you can tell from first paragraph I’m a student of applied informatics(getting my bachelors degree). I’m working as junior developer (working currently with Spring and Angular). Some pretty standard stuff. But I really, really love React. Also functional programming (just as hobby, because at my faculty there are no courses on functional programming and at work we don’t use any (primary) functional languages). I really like idea of functional programming and it’s mathematical roots.<br>
<br>

## Summary

As I’ve mentioned I don't want to share my specific plans with this blog, but I can share a rough outline of what I’m trying to accomplish:

* Tutorial for beginners (probably JS and React)
* Advanced React topics
* Adventures from professional life
* Functional programming
* Maybe some DevOps?
<br>
So that is my vision for this thing that I’m trying to build, but I also want to hear your opinion of that would you like to read in this place.<br>

Thanks for your 5 minutes and I hope you will enjoy my content.

Cheers.
<br>
